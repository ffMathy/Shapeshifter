# Want to see releases more often?

# Shapeshifter
Shapeshifter is a revolutionary clipboard manager that you might know of already. 

- Version 6 (new experimental version): https://github.com/ffMathy/Shapeshifter/releases/latest
- Version 5 (current latest stable, not supported anymore in favor of Version 6): https://github.com/ffMathy/Shapeshifter/releases/tag/shapeshifter-v5.0.107

# Contributing
Feel free to contribute to Shapeshifter 6 development! Create a pull request, and we'll look at it. *The repository has a DotSettings ReSharper file included, which comes with the conventions we want to use for this repository. These conventions also contain a few templates for creating Unit Tests.*

# Can Shapeshifter be trusted?
Shapeshifter can be fully trusted, and hopefully having it 100% open-source helps showing that. Shapeshifter will not send your clipboard data to anyone, and if we collect data, it will be 100% anonymous (for instance, how many installs of Shapeshifter we have, or how many downloads).

Some bright developers may have noticed that there are executable files inside the project. These files come from the [EasyHook](https://easyhook.github.io) NuGet package, which is also open source. If you still don't trust that these are the original EasyHook executables, feel free to run an MD5 hash of the ones from the source code and compare them to the originally distributed EasyHook files.
