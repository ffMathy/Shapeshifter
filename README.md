# Shapeshifter
Shapeshifter is a revolutionary clipboard manager that you might know of already. It can be downloaded [here](http://flamefusion.net/software/shapeshifter),
although that link is for Version 5. 

Version 6 is the first version to go Open Source, on this repository. It is a complete rewrite, so expect it to take some time to get it ready.

## Accelerate development
We represent a small group of friends working on Shapeshifter in our spare time (which we don't have a lot of). If you like our effort, feel free to tip us a bit.
Every dollar matters!

#Download alpha version
An alpha version of a software comes before the beta version. It means that not all features have been implemented, and that nothing is expected to work.

If you're aware of this and still want to try Shapeshifter 5, the releases can be found here: https://github.com/ffMathy/Shapeshifter/releases
